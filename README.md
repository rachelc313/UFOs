## Overview of the Analysis
Data is a data journalist that has been given the opportunity to perform an analysis on her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. McMinnville is famous for its UFO sightings. Dana has a JavaScript file with UFO sighting data and information. 

The purpose of the analysis was to create a website with Dana's article, a table of the data, and search filters to search through the data.


## Results
After navigating to the website, there are five search filters. When the user types in the search criteria then navigates out of the textbox or presses enter, the table filters to the applicable data. 

The table can be filtered even further by adding more search criteria.

## Summary
A drawback of the website is that all of the data is displayed on the page and there is only one page to the website.

My first recommendation would be to create multiple pages for the data. This would create a more concise website. 

My second recommendation would be to include links to the original reports or articles. This along with a references page would add credibility to the site as well as allow further research and analysis.

A contact page would be useful for questions, as well as reports and additional data.
